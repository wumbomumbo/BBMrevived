# BBMrevived
**An open-source recreation of BBM services**

⚠️ **Warning:** Currently, it is only possible to login to BBM. The APIs only return placeholder data to demonstrate that login is even possible. It is also unstable, and can cause your system to slow down.

---

## ✅ What works
- Logging in to BBM.

## ❌ What doesn’t
- Everything beyond login, the app stays stuck on the “setting up” screen because it cannot connect to a chat server, closing the app and relaunching just gets it stuck on the loading screen.

---

## 📱 Supported BBM versions
- **2.13.0.26** (extracted from a BlackBerry PRIV)

---

## 🛠️ How do I get started?

Please read [USAGE.md](USAGE.md)

---

## 📌 Project status
This project is a proof of concept and is not even remotely ready for daily use.  
Pull requests, issues, and discussions are very welcome!

---

## 🛠️ Future goals
- Getting past the “setting up” screen.
- User accounts.
- Add better documentation on setting up the environment and patching the app.
